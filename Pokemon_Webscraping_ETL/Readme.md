# POKEMON WEBSCRAPING PROJECT

This project entails extracting data from a Pokémon website using web scraping techniques to gather information such as Pokémon attributes, abilities, and statistics. Once extracted, the data is transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis, possibly using Python libraries like pandas for cleaning and structuring.

Next, the transformed data is loaded into a Databricks database table, leveraging Databricks utilities or SQL commands to define the schema and store the dataset securely. This step ensures that the data is easily accessible and queryable within the Databricks environment.

Finally, for visualization purposes, sample visualizations are generated to explore insights such as distributions of Pokémon types, strengths, or evolutionary trends. These visualizations offer a clear, graphical representation of the data, aiding in understanding and decision-making based on Pokémon characteristics.

Overall, this project integrates web scraping, data transformation, database management, and visualization techniques to analyze Pokémon data efficiently within the Databricks platform.
